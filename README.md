# Project Overview

The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing challenge built using Python.
The program randomly selects a fruit name, and the player must guess the letters within a limited number of chances.
This beginner-friendly project strengthens concepts like loops, conditionals, string handling, and user input validation, while providing a fun way to practice logical thinking.

# Features

Randomly selects a fruit name from a predefined list.
Hints help the player guess the word’s category (fruits).
Tracks correct and incorrect guesses.
Validates user input to prevent repeated or invalid letters.
Displays current progress after every guess.
Announces win or loss based on remaining chances.

# What You’ll cover

Through this project, you’ll practice key Python concepts:

Working with loops and conditional statements

Handling user input

Using lists and strings effectively

Applying logical checks for game outcomes

Implementing error handling with try/except

# Technologies Used

Language: Python 3

Libraries:

random → for selecting a random word

collections.Counter → for comparing guessed letters (optional in some versions)
# How to run
1. Save the source file hangman.py
in your project folder.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in that folder.
3. Save the source file **[hangman_game.py](./hangman_game.py)** in your project folder.
3. Guess one letter at a time (or try the full word).
4. You win if you guess all the letters before running out of chances!
