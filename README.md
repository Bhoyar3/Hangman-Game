# Project Overview

The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing challenge built using Python.
The program randomly selects a fruit name, and the player must guess the letters within a limited number of chances.
This beginner-friendly project strengthens concepts like loops, conditionals, string handling, and user input validation, while providing a fun way to practice logical thinking.

# Features

Randomly selects a fruit name from a predefined list.
Hints help the player guess the word’s category (fruits).
Tracks correct and incorrect guesses.
Validates user input to prevent repeated or invalid letters.
Displays current progress after every guess.
Announces win or loss based on remaining chances.

# What You’ll cover
